Infrastructure as a code:

> Described an executable textual format.

> Configure using that description.

> Configuration management systems make this possible.

> Never perform configurations manually.

> Use version Control.

Ephimerable immutable infrastructure:

> Server drift is a major source of failure.

> Serveers are cattle not pets.

> Infrastructure is transistent.

> Build through parralel infrastructure.

Immutable delivery via containers:

> Applications are packed in containers.

> Same containers that runs in prduction can be run locally.

> Dependcies are containered.

> No variance limits sidel-effects.

> Rolling updates with immediate roll-back.

Immutable way of working:

> You never make changes in the running containers.

> You make changes to the image.

> Then redeploy the new container.

> keep images up to date.
