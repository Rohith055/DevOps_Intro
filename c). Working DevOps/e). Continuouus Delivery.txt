Continuous Delivery:

" Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time."

										- martin Fowler.

Release Production at any time:

> The master branch should always be ready to deploy.

> You need a way to know if something will "break the build"

> Deliver every change to a production like environment.

CI/CD Pipeline:

Automated gateways that create a pipeline of checks:

> Unit Testing

> Code quality checks.

> Integration testing.

> Security testing.

> Vulnerablity Scanning.

> Package Signing.

A CI/CD Pipeline needs:

> A code Repository.

> A build Server

> An artifact repository.

> Automatic Configuration & Deployment.

Five Key Principles:

> Build quality in

> Work in small batches.

> Computers perform repetitive tasks, people solve provblems.

> Retentlessly pursue continuous improvement.

> Everyone is responsible.

How DevOps Manages Risk:

> Deployment is a King.

> Deployment is decoupled from activation.

> Deployment is not "one size fits all"
