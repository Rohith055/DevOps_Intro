Conway's Law 

"Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will producw a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure."
								- Melvin Conway, Datamation, 1968.

Align teams with the business:

> Each team has its own mission aligned with the business.

> Teams have end-to-end responsiblity for what they build.

> Teams should have a long term mission usually around a single business domain.


DevOps is not a team or a job title:

" The DevOps movement addresses the dysfunction that results from organizations composed of functional silos. Thus, creating another functional silo that sits between Dev and Ops is clearly a poor (and ironic) way to try and solve these problems. "

Bad Behaviour

" Bad Behaviour arises when you abstract people away from the consequences of their actions"
