 Metrics:

 â€œWhether dealing with monkeys, rats, or human beings, it is hardly 
controversial to state that most organisms seek information 
concerning what activities are rewarded, and then seek to do (or at 
least pretend to do) those things, often to the virtual exclusion of 
activities not rewarded. The extent to which this occurs, of course, 
will depend on the perceived attractiveness of the reward offered, 
but neither operant nor expectancy theorists would quarrel with the 
essence of this notion"
