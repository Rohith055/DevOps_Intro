Site Reliablity Engineering:

" What happens when a software is tasked with what used to be called operations."
										- Ben Treynor Sloss.

Goal: Automate yourself out of a job.

Tenets of SRE:

> Hire only Software engineers.

> Site reliablity engineers work on reducing toil through automation.

> SRE teams are separate from development teams.

> Stability is controlled through error budgets.

> Developers rotate through operations

Team Differences:

> SRE maintains separate development and operations teams, but it does have one staffing pool.

> DevOps on the other hand breaks down the silos into one team with one common business objective.

Commonality:

Both seek to make both Dev and Ops work visible to each other.

Both require a blameless culture.

This objective of both is to deploy software faster with stability.

DevOps + SRE 

> SRE maintains the Infrastructure.

> DevOps uses the infrastructure to maintain their applications.
