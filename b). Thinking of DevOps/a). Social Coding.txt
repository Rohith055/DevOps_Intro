Scoial Coding:

> open Source Practice

> All repositories are public

> Everyone os encouraged to contribute

> Anarchy is controlled via pull request.

Code reuse Dilemma:

> Code has 80% of what you have need but 20% is missing.

> How does you add 20% missing features ?

> Make a feature request and depend on another team ?

Social Coding Solution

> Discuss with the repo owner 

> Agree to develop it 

> Open an issue and assign it to yourself.

> Fork the code and make your changes.

> Issue a pull request to review and merge back.

This is how a open source works.

Pair Programming:

> Two programmers on one workstation.

> The pilot is sailing the ship and the navigator is montoring the pilot whether he  is going in the correct flow or not. 

> Every twenty hrs they can switch their roles.

benefits

> Higher code quality

> Defects are foound to be earlier. 

> Lower maintenance costs

> Skills Transfer

> every lines on the code can be monitored by one or more person.

> Broder understanding of the codebase.
