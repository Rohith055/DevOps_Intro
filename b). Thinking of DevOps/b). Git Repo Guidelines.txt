Git Repo Guidelines.

> Create a repository on git separately for every component.

> Create a new branch for every issue.

> Use pull request to merge to mater branch.

> Every pull request is an opportunity to review the code.

Branch Workflow:

Repo       -  remote branch

local repo - Local branch

 Workign on small batches would minimizes the resource wastage, eficient work will be received.

 Measuring the size of the batches,

> Feature size supports frequent releases.

> Features should be completed in a sprint.

> Features are a step toward a goal, so keep as much as small.

MVP - Minimum Viable Product:

> MVP is not "Phase 1" of a project.

> It is an experiment to test your hypothesis.

> It is focused on learning, not delivery.

Basically it iteratively work to build a product with more steps and analysis of their own product.

Giving the customer's main need is the most important thing in the delivery.

> MVP is tool for learning.

> Failure leads to understanding.
