WaterFall Development 

Requirements
	 		-> Design 	
	 					-> Code
	 							 -> Integration 
	 							 				-> Test
	 							 						-> Deploy

Problems 

No Provisions for changing the requirements

no Idea if it works until the end 

Each step ends with the new begining

Mistakes found in later stages are more expensive to fix

There is usually a long time between software releases.

Teams work separately, unware of their impact on each other

The people who know are deploying it into production
